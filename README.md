# Lab-Activity-3

In this activity, I learned Python and Javascript to implement sorting algorithms, bubble sort and insertion sort. 

I've included the source code for both bubble sort and insertion sort after I had written those algorithms in pseudocode. Writing them in pseudocode first made me 
understand the the concepts that I needed to learn for both langugaes.
