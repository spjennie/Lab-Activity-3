start the for loop at 1 because in the first step, the sub-array only contains the value at index 0 and has a length of 1
	 for (let i = 1; i < length; i++)

add the key to inputArr[j + 1] because inputArr[j] would correspond to the first item in the sub-array whose value is less than the key's value
	 inputArr[j + 1] = key;

while conditional
	while (j >= 0 && inputArr[j] > key)

assignment statements
	let length = inputArr.length;
	let i = 1
	let key = inputArr[i];
	let j = i - 1;

for loop
	for (let i = 1; i < length; i++)
